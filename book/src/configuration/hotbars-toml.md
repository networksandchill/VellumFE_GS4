# hotbars.toml

Named bars of buttons for the [hotbars widget](../widgets/hotkeybar.md).

**Prefer the built-in editor over hand-editing:** `.hotbars` opens the
hotbar editor in both TUI and GUI.

Location: `~/.vellum-fe/global/hotbars.toml`, plus an optional
per-character `~/.vellum-fe/profiles/<name>/hotbars.toml`. A character bar
with the same name replaces the global one entirely.

## Bars and Buttons

```toml
[[bars]]
name = "default"      # referenced by hotkeybar windows in layout.toml
title = "Actions"
icon_size = 48        # optional: icon face edge in px (GUI; default 24)

[[bars.buttons]]
id = "hide"           # stable id, unique within the bar
label = "Hide"        # text shown on the button
command = "hide"      # game command sent on click or hotkey
hotkey = "alt+h"      # optional (keybinds.toml syntax); keybinds.toml wins on conflict
tooltip = "Attempt to hide"   # hover text (GUI)
category = "Stealth"  # editor grouping only
```

## Countdowns

An optional `[bars.buttons.countdown]` overlays remaining seconds on the
button:

```toml
[bars.buttons.countdown]
source = "roundtime"          # "roundtime" | "casttime" | "effect"
```

For `source = "effect"`, name the effect to track:

```toml
[bars.buttons.countdown]
source = "effect"
category = "Buffs"            # Buffs | Debuffs | Cooldowns | ActiveSpells
name = "Celerity"
name_match = "exact"          # "exact" or "contains"
```

## Conditional States

`[[bars.buttons.states]]` entries restyle a button while a condition holds.
The first matching state wins. Each state has a `when` condition and a
`style`:

```toml
# Show the Hide button green and relabeled while hidden
[[bars.buttons.states]]
[bars.buttons.states.when]
type = "indicator"
id = "hidden"
active = true
[bars.buttons.states.style]
label = "Hidden"
fg = "#80ff80"

# Dim it during roundtime
[[bars.buttons.states]]
[bars.buttons.states.when]
type = "rt_active"
[bars.buttons.states.style]
dim = true
```

### Condition Types

| `type` | Fields | Matches when |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| `effect_active` | `category`, `name`, `name_match` | The effect is up |
| `effect_inactive` | `category`, `name`, `name_match` | The effect is not up |
| `effect_time` | `category`, `name`, `name_match`, `cmp`, `seconds` | Remaining time compares true (e.g. `cmp = "<"`, `seconds = 30`) |
| `rt_active` | — | Roundtime is running |
| `ct_active` | — | Casttime is running |
| `indicator` | `id`, `active` | A status indicator matches: `standing`, `kneeling`, `sitting`, `prone`, `stunned`, `bleeding`, `hidden`, `invisible`, `webbed`, `joined`, `dead` |
| `vital` | `vital`, `cmp`, `value`, `unit` | A vital compares true: `health`/`mana`/`stamina`/`spirit`, `cmp` one of `<` `<=` `>` `>=`, `unit` `"percent"` or `"absolute"` |
| `spell_affordable` | `number` | The bundled spell table lists static costs for that spell number and your current absolute vitals cover them. Works without Lich. Fails closed on unknown numbers, variable (formula) costs, or before vitals data arrives; unlike Lich's `affordable?` it does not model feats or debuffs. |
| `all` / `any` | `conditions = [ ... ]` | All / any of the nested conditions match |

### Style Fields

| Field | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `label` | Replace the button text |
| `fg` / `bg` | Text / background color (`#rrggbb`) |
| `dim` | Render the button dimmed |
| `icon` | Icon override for this state (see Icons below) |

A state may also carry its own `[bars.buttons.states.countdown]` (same
schema as the button-level countdown); while the state is active it
replaces the button-level source — e.g. show the cooldown timer only in
the "on cooldown" state. Likewise `command = "..."` on a state replaces
the button's command while active (literal text — `;eq ...` commands are
evaluated by Lich, so dynamic behavior belongs in the command itself).

## Icons (GUI)

Buttons can show an image face from a registered sprite sheet. Sheets are
tiled into fixed-size cells with no padding, numbered 1-based left→right
then top→bottom — the barbar convention. The TUI always renders the text
label; icons are ignored there, and the GUI falls back to text when no
registered sheet matches.

Sheets live in one of two places:

- **Shared store** (`~/.vellum-fe/global/images/icons/` with an
  `icons.toml` manifest) — available to every skin, and with no skin
  active at all. This is the default and the right choice for personal
  icon sets.
- **Active skin** (the skin's `[sheets]` table in `skin.toml`, see the
  skin docs) — travels with the skin; a skin sheet overrides a shared
  sheet with the same name.

**The `.hotbars` editor does all of this without TOML:** the button form
has a Face selector (Text / Icon / Icon + label), a sheet dropdown, a
clickable "Pick cell from sheet" grid, grayscale/border controls, and the
same icon controls on every state card. The editor's "Icon sheets"
section registers a new sheet — give it a name and an image path and it
copies the image into the shared store (or, with "All skins" unticked,
into the active skin) and records it in the matching manifest for you.
Each state card also carries its own countdown source ("Countdown while
active") that replaces the button-level one while the state matches.

```toml
[[bars.buttons]]
id = "hide"
label = "Hide"
command = "hide"
icon_mode = "icon"            # "text" (default) | "icon" | "icon_and_label"

[bars.buttons.icon]
sheet = "rogue"               # sheet name from the skin's [sheets] table
cell = 5                      # 1-based cell index
grayscale = false             # desaturate (e.g. for a "not ready" look)
border = "#00ff00"            # optional solid border over the icon
border_width = 3              # pixels, 1-10 (default 2)
border_end = "#004400"        # optional: gradient border toward this color
border_dir = "radial"         # horizontal (default) | vertical |
                              # diagonal_down | diagonal_up | radial | square
```

With `icon_mode = "icon"` the label moves into the hover tooltip. States
can swap the icon (a different cell, or the same cell grayscaled) via
`[bars.buttons.states.style.icon]` — dimmed states automatically use the
grayscale variant. The sheet entry itself — in the shared store's
`icons.toml` (paths relative to `global/images/icons/`) or a skin's `skin.toml`
(paths relative to the skin directory) — looks the same either way:

```toml
[sheets.rogue]
path = "icons/rogue.png"      # image path; absolute paths allowed
cell = 64                     # cell edge in pixels (default 64)
```

## Reloading

`.reload hotbars` re-reads the file; the editor saves and applies
immediately.
