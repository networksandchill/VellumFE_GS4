//! The walk loop — go2.lic's executor (lines ~2311–2505) as an event-driven
//! state machine. No sleeps, no blocking: the frontend ticks it with a
//! snapshot of the world (`TravelContext`) and it answers with commands to
//! send and messages to show.
//!
//! Ported behavior, one room at a time (typeahead pipelining is go2's most
//! fragile code and deliberately v1-out):
//! - Dead aborts. Stunned/webbed waits (go2's `muckled?` gate).
//! - Not standing (and the edge isn't swim/pedal): wait out RT, `stand`,
//!   re-check; repeated failures abort.
//! - Wait out RT, send the edge command, await the expected room.
//! - A step that times out retries; repeated failure on the same edge
//!   disables that edge for the session and re-paths — go2's
//!   "changing timeto to nil" + `$go2_restart` loop.
//! - Ending up in an unexpected (but mapped) room re-paths from there.
